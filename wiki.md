> Welcome to the official wikipedia of the unofficial version of AUNIS mode!
***
# What is Aunis?
- Aunis is a mod on **version 1.12.2**, inspired by the Stargate series. Adds transport devices such as Stargates and transport rings to Minecraft.
- And the name? Aunis is actually an abbreviation of "All you(u) need is stargate"

# Stargate
- The Stargate is a device that creates an artificial wormhole between two gates. After entering the gate, you are moved (teleported) to the position of the second gate.
- Traveling works only in one direction, because nothing can pass through the wormhole, except in the radio / electromagnetic / gravitational field, in both directions.
- For more info **[HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(device))**

***
## Gate construction
- After placing the base block, you will see the "hologram" of the gate structure (location of the blocks)
- If you click on individual base blocks of the gate (member blocks), the gate will build itself (if you have enough of those member blocks)

***
## Gate types
- Mod contains 4 types of gates:
### Orlin´s
- A small gate with a diameter of two blocks
- **It is only possible to travel to the Netherlands through the gate**
- It is charged using the supplied cable through which the RF units flow
- **Activated by a redstone signal (eg lever)**
- The address of this gate is static, which means that it does not change → the address is the Earth address from the series![Your browser does not support this image type :(](https://rdanderson.com/stargate/glyphs/addresses/earth.png)
- **The gate has a maximum of two uses !!! (there and back)**
### Universe
- Larger diameter gate
- The range of the gate is very small (can be set in aunis.cfg (hereinafter only config))
- You can only dial with a computer from Open Computers mode (see **[Integration](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#integration-supported-mods)**) , or **[Universe Dialer](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#universe-dialer)**
- Cannot insert **[Capacitors](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#capacitor)** (can be edited in config) or **[Iris upgrade](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#iris-upgrade)**
### MilkyWay
- The gate size can be set in the config
- **Much greater range (unlimited)**
- You can dial the gate using **[MilkyWay DHD](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#milkyway-dhd)** or a computer
- Up to 3 **[Capacitors](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#capacitor)** and **[Iris upgrade](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#iris-upgrade)**
### Pegasus
- The gate size can be set in the config
- **Range is also unlimited**
- You can dial the gate using **[MilkyWay DHD](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#milkyway-dhd)** or a computer
- Up to 3 **[Capacitors](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#capacitor)** and **[Iris upgrade](https://github.com/MineDragonCZ/Aunis1/wiki/EN-US#iris-upgrade)**
- Computer dialing is faster than with the MilkyWay gate

# Transport Rings
- Transport Rings (TR)
- Something like an "elevator"
- Transfers objects (entities) along the vertical axis -> have a range of 255 in height, but + -25 in width
- **Fast transport**
- The address consists of one "symbol"
- **You can travel in both directions**
***
## Transport Rings Construction
- Place the TR block (preferably one block under the ground) and right-click on it
- Set the address and name (address must be between 1-6 and any name)
- Save it
- Place the TR controller on the wall near the TR block and select the address
- The address on the TR controller is calculated from left to right from top to bottom

# Craftings
- Personally, I think most people are so clever that they use **[JEI (Just Enough Items)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei)**
